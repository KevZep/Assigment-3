Assignment 3 for CS303


Instruction: 
  The program has both requirements: a Queue and an Infix to Postfix Conversion. You will be given a menu to choose between 1) Infix to Postfix Conversion and 2) Queue, with 0 to end the program. If you choose 2, you won't be able to return to the main menu and have to restart the program.
  1) Infix to Postfix Conversion
     Could you just input the corresponding string you want to be converted? some examples to test are: 2+3*4 , 3*4+2*5 , 3*(4+2)*5 , and A+B*(C^D-E).
     If you have (), {}, or [], make sure they are open and close for each {,[,(. If you don't do it, you will be an error. Ex.: A+B([C^D+E] will crash if the ( is incomplete. You need the ) at the proper place.

  2) Queue
       You will be given a menu of your choice; select it with the number next to it. If you enter 0, the program will end, thus having to re-start the program again to choose the other options in the main menu.

Once done, enter 0 to end the program.
